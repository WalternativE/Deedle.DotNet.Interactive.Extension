## How to get these bits? Gimme!

I have a feed for experimental packages [on MyGet](https://www.myget.org/feed/Packages/gregs-experimental-packages) there you can find the
[Deedle.DotNet.Interactive.Extension](https://www.myget.org/feed/gregs-experimental-packages/package/nuget/Deedle.DotNet.Interactive.Extension). Add the feed to your NuGet source list and reference the extension in your notebook.

```
#r "nuget: Deedle.DotNet.Interactive.Extension,0.1.0-alpha1
```
